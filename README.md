# Nebula Builder

## Introduction
Nebula Builder is a project made to easily build simple websites with content, a little bit like CMS systems, using Meteor. It is in fact a Meteor project, ready to use when installed, to build your own website without further coding. You only need to know how to use the most basic shell commands of your OS.


## Features
- manage your website from one place, a simple administration panel
- create and manage pages
- for each page, manage their layout with a block structure, using simple drag and drop system
- using the same drag and drop system, place content in your pages : formatted text, pictures, etc.
- edit the text directly into the pages, or in a part of the administration panel dedicated to it
- choose the global template for your website and edit the style of it
- by cloning this repository, you can easily keep your own Nebula Builder instance up to date

## Getting started

Three easy steps:
- First, install the latest version of Meteor (http://meteor.com).
- Then, clone this repository and make sure everything is correctly installed (the current version of Meteor requires you to manually install the babel-runtime npm package, using the command : `meteor npm install --save babel-runtime` in your repository).
- launch the web server using the command: `meteor` in your repository.

That's it! Check that everything is fine by browsing to http://localhost:3000 .
