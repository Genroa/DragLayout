# Nebula Builder

## Introduction
Nebula Builder is a project made to easily build simple websites with content, a little bit like CMS systems, using Meteor. It is in fact a Meteor project, ready to use when installed, to build your own website without further coding. You only need to know how to use the most basic shell commands of your OS.


## Features
- manage your website from one place, a simple administration panel
- create and manage pages
- for each page, manage their layout with a block structure, using simple drag and drop system
- using the same drag and drop system, place content in your pages : formatted text, pictures, etc.
- edit the text directly into the pages, or in a part of the administration panel dedicated to it
- choose the global template for your website and edit the style of it
- easily add new types of content and new global templates using the Meteor packages system and the packages made for it
- by cloning this repository, you can easily keep your own Nebula Builder instance up to date

# WARNING : THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROJECT, CONSIDER IT AS A DRAFT. DON'T USE IT IN ITS CURRENT STATE.

## Getting started

Three easy steps:
- First, install the latest version of Meteor (http://meteor.com).
- Then, clone this repository and make sure everything is correctly installed
- launch the web server using the command: `meteor` in your repository.

That's it! Check that everything is fine by browsing to http://localhost:3000 . The first time might take a while, because Meteor needs to download all the packages Nebula Builder uses.

## I've installed it and my server is running. How should I manage my website now?

For more information about the management of a Nebula website, take a look at the [short documentation](https://genroa.github.io/Nebula-Builder/) explaining how to start creating your pages, managing your content, change a global template, etc.
